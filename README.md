| [Why Safeguarded Ships Run Aground? Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13946) | Wenjie Li, Jian Wang, Qingyu Yin, Chak Tou Leong | - This paper investigates a phenomenon called Template-Anchored Safety Alignment (TASA) in large language models (LLMs), where safety mechanisms overly rely on the template region between user instruction and model output. - The study confirms TASA's presence across various aligned LLMs through experiments showing attention shifts from instruction to template regions when processing harmful requests, and interventions in the template region significantly influence safety decisions. - A strong link is established between TASA and LLM vulnerabilities, as manipulating template information during response generation allows harmful requests to bypass safeguards, and common attacks disrupt the processing of harmfulness features within this region. - Detaching the safety mechanism from the template by transferring harmfulness probes and injecting them during generation, effectively mitigates these vulnerabilities and improves model robustness. - The findings highlight the need for more sophisticated safety alignment methods that avoid over-reliance on shortcuts like template information. | ['Natural Language Processing'] | N/A | N/A |

| [Eager Updates For Overlapped Communication and Computation in DiLoCo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12996) | Yanislav Donchev, Arthur Douillard, Satyen Kale | - This paper introduces "eager updates," a technique to improve the efficiency of distributed training for large language models (LLMs) using the DiLoCo method. - Eager updates mitigate communication bottlenecks by overlapping the communication of outer gradients with the computation of the next inner optimization phase. - A naive implementation of this approach leads to reduced convergence speed. Thus, the authors propose an "eager" version that utilizes local outer gradients as a proxy during the overlap, improving convergence compared to the naive version. - Experiments demonstrate that eager updates reduce bandwidth requirements significantly, approaching 95% compute utilization for 1B, 10B, and 100B parameter models with bandwidths between 1 and 5 Gbit/s. - Evaluating on C4 and HellaSwag datasets reveals competitive performance compared to standard DiLoCo and significant improvements over naive delayed outer gradient updates, particularly under low bandwidth conditions. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Generation'] | N/A | N/A |

Souza, Pedro H. V. Valois | - This paper introduces the Frame Representation Hypothesis (FRH), a new framework for interpreting and controlling Large Language Models (LLMs) by modeling multi-token words as frames, which are ordered sequences of independent vectors. - FRH extends the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) which was limited to single-token words, and makes it applicable to multi-token words and thus any textual data. - The paper proposes Concept Frames, which are centroids of a set of word frames that share a common concept, and shows that over 99% of words composed of several tokens are composed of linearly independent token vectors. - A Top-k Concept-Guided Decoding method is introduced for steering text generation using chosen concepts, which helps to expose and potentially remediate biases present in LLMs. - Experiments on Llama 3.1, Gemma 2, and Phi 3 demonstrate FRH's ability to expose biases and steer text generation, showing its applicability to enhance the transparency and controllability of LLMs. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Generation'] | [Link](https://github.com/phvv-me/frame-representation-hypothesis.git) | N/A |

| [Do I Know This Entity? Knowledge Awareness and Hallucinations in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14257) | Neel Nanda, Senthooran Rajamanoharan, Oscar Obeso, Javier Ferrando | - This paper investigates the mechanisms behind hallucinations in large language models (LLMs), focusing on entity recognition as a key factor. - Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as an interpretability tool, the researchers discovered directions in the representation space that detect whether a model recognizes an entity, indicating a form of self-knowledge about its capabilities. - These directions are causally relevant, capable of steering the model to refuse answering questions about known entities or hallucinate about unknown ones.  - The study demonstrates that chat fine-tuning repurposes this existing mechanism from the base model, and that unknown entity recognition directions disrupt the factual recall mechanism by suppressing attention of attribute extraction heads. - Additionally, the researchers identify SAE latents seemingly representing uncertainty, which are predictive of incorrect answers. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering'] | N/A | [Link](https://huggingface.co/jbloom/Gemma-2b-IT-Residual-Stream-SAEs), [Link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb) |

| [MLLM can see? Dynamic Correction Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11779) | Haoming Xu, Bozhong Tian, Xiang Chen, Chenxi Wang, Ningyu | This paper introduces DeCo, a novel dynamic correction decoding method for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) designed to mitigate hallucinations by leveraging information from preceding layers. - DeCo dynamically selects an appropriate preceding layer ("anchor layer") based on the probabilities of candidate tokens, and integrates its knowledge into the final layer to adjust the output logits, thereby correcting potential hallucinations. - The method is training-free and model-agnostic, compatible with various decoding strategies (greedy search, nucleus sampling, beam search) and applicable to different MLLMs. - Experimental results on benchmarks like CHAIR and POPE demonstrate that DeCo significantly reduces hallucination rates compared to baselines and existing methods like OPERA and VCD, with an average suppression rate of 10.8% on image captioning datasets. - Empirical analysis suggests that MLLMs can recognize visual objects in earlier layers, but this recognition is suppressed in later layers due to language model priors, leading to hallucinations. DeCo addresses this by correcting final-layer logits using more accurate information from preceding layers. - Further analysis shows DeCo is also effective in reducing snowballing hallucinations, where an initial hallucination leads to a cascade of errors. | ['Multimodal', 'Image-to-Text'] | [Link](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeCo) | N/A |
