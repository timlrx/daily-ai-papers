| [Instruction Following without Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14254) | Christopher D. Manning, Percy Liang, Nelson F. Liu, John Hewitt | This research paper explores alternative training methods for language models to exhibit instruction-following behavior without explicit instruction tuning. - The authors demonstrate that "response tuning," which involves training solely on the responses without corresponding instructions, can lead to instruction following, suggesting an implicit instruction-response mapping learned during pretraining. - Additionally, the study reveals that "single-task finetuning,"  training on narrow-domain data like poetry generation, yields broad instruction-following capabilities, indicating that models learn more than just the specific task. -  The paper provides evidence that a simple 3-rule rule-based adapter can achieve comparable performance to instruction-tuned models, highlighting the potential for simplified approaches to instruction following. - These findings suggest that instruction following might be a more fundamental property of language models acquired through various adaptation methods, even those not explicitly designed for this purpose. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Generation'] | N/A | N/A |

| [EMOVA: Empowering Language Models to See, Hear and Speak with Vivid Emotions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18042) | vikyzeng2, 17day, zhili-liu, gyhdog, KaiChen1998 | This paper introduces EMOVA, a novel end-to-end multimodal large language model capable of perceiving and generating images, text, and speech with emotional expressiveness. EMOVA utilizes a continuous vision encoder for detailed visual understanding and a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer/detokenizer for end-to-end speech processing.  The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both vision-language and speech benchmarks, outperforming models like GPT-4V and Gemini Pro 1.5 on 10 out of 14 vision-language tasks and surpassing the speech LLM Mini-Omni in ASR tasks. EMOVA also enables emotional spoken dialogue by explicitly predicting speech style labels (emotions and pitches) and leveraging a lightweight style module for controllable speech synthesis. This is achieved through a novel text-centric multimodal alignment approach, which leverages publicly available bimodal data and eliminates the reliance on scarce trimodal data. | ['Multimodal', 'Text-to-Speech', 'Automatic Speech Recognition', 'Image-to-Text', 'Visual Question Answering'] | N/A | N/A |
