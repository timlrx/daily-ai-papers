| [What Happened in LLMs Layers when Trained for Fast vs. Slow Thinking: A Gradient Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23743) | Tianyi Zhou, Yanhong Li, MingLiiii | - This research paper investigates the layer-wise gradient patterns in Large Language Models (LLMs) during instruction-tuning with different reasoning approaches (fast vs. slow thinking) and response types. - It uses spectral analysis, specifically Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and nuclear norm, to characterize gradient behaviors across LLM layers for tasks involving math, commonsense reasoning, and knowledge learning. - Slow thinking, using detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT), results in more stable and uniform gradient norms across layers compared to fast thinking, suggesting improved learning stability. - The gradients associated with slow thinking effectively differentiate correct from irrelevant responses in reasoning tasks, while in knowledge learning tasks, gradient norms are sensitive to knowledge popularity but not correctness.  - The study also finds that instruction-tuned LLMs do not show significant advantages over pre-trained LLMs in identifying incorrect reasoning and have different gradient patterns for fast thinking responses, suggesting challenges in aligning with the instruction-tuning data. | ['Natural Language Processing'] | [Link](https://github.com/MingLiiii/Layer_Gradient) | N/A |

| [Fictitious Synthetic Data Can Improve LLM Factuality via Prerequisite Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19290) | Yang Zhang, Tommi Jaakkola, code-terminator, yujianll | - PREREQ-TUNE, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to mitigate LLM hallucinations, is introduced. - PREREQ-TUNE incorporates a two-stage process: a prerequisite learning stage where a knowledge LoRA is trained to acquire necessary knowledge, followed by a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage where a skill LoRA focuses solely on learning task-specific skills.  The prerequisite learning stage enhances factuality by equipping the LLM with the required knowledge for subsequent fine-tuning, thereby reducing reliance on generating incorrect information. - The method also utilizes fictitious synthetic data for multi-version training, further improving the grounding of LLM outputs to internal knowledge.

| [MLLM can see? Dynamic Correction Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11779) | Haoming Xu, Bozhong Tian, Xiang Chen, Chenxi Wang, Ningyu | This paper introduces DeCo, a novel dynamic correction decoding method for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) designed to mitigate hallucinations by leveraging information from preceding layers. - DeCo dynamically selects an appropriate preceding layer ("anchor layer") based on the probabilities of candidate tokens, and integrates its knowledge into the final layer to adjust the output logits, thereby correcting potential hallucinations. - The method is training-free and model-agnostic, compatible with various decoding strategies (greedy search, nucleus sampling, beam search) and applicable to different MLLMs. - Experimental results on benchmarks like CHAIR and POPE demonstrate that DeCo significantly reduces hallucination rates compared to baselines and existing methods like OPERA and VCD, with an average suppression rate of 10.8% on image captioning datasets. - Empirical analysis suggests that MLLMs can recognize visual objects in earlier layers, but this recognition is suppressed in later layers due to language model priors, leading to hallucinations. DeCo addresses this by correcting final-layer logits using more accurate information from preceding layers. - Further analysis shows DeCo is also effective in reducing snowballing hallucinations, where an initial hallucination leads to a cascade of errors. | ['Multimodal', 'Image-to-Text'] | [Link](https://github.com/zjunlp/DeCo) | N/A |

| [Hyper-multi-step: The Truth Behind Difficult Long-context Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04422) | yuyijiong |  - This paper investigates the underlying reasons why Long Context Language Models (LCLMs) struggle with complex tasks, despite their ability to handle extensive text.  - Through experiments with synthetic datasets, the study identifies "multi-matching retrieval" (retrieving multiple items simultaneously) and "logic-based retrieval" (using logic within retrieval criteria) as the core challenges, and further defines them as "hyper-multi-step" problems. - "Hyper-multi-step" implies that these seemingly simple tasks actually comprise a large number of indivisible sub-steps, which increases with context length and exceeds the processing capacity of current LCLMs.  - The paper provides empirical evidence through linear probing of hidden states and analysis of attention weights, demonstrating that these problems are more akin to complex arithmetic tasks, rather than traditional retrieval, and are therefore not adequately addressed by existing techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.  - The study concludes that simply increasing the context window size of LCLMs may not suffice; instead, future research should focus on addressing the numerous steps involved and explore alternative solutions, such as using external tools. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering'] | N/A | N/A |

DMU fine-tunes multiple CLIP models from a pre-trained checkpoint using Multistage Contrastive Learning (MCL) to capture diverse feature distributions.

Notably, CLIP-MoE surpasses the base OpenAI CLIP model by approximately 20% on retrieval tasks and exhibits minimal additional training overhead, using only 2% of the computational resources required to train a CLIP from scratch. This method provides a model-agnostic and computationally efficient way to scale CLIP and enhance its ability to capture rich, fine-grained information for improved performance in various multimodal applications. | ['Multimodal', 'Image Feature Extraction', 'Zero-Shot Image Classification'] | [Link](https://github.com/OpenSparseLLMS/CLIP-MOE) | N/A |

DiVA utilizes a novel cross-modal context distillation method, which uses a frozen text-based LLM to guide the audio model's training by matching the output distribution from text transcripts of the audio. The audio input is processed using Whisper for feature extraction and a Q-Former initialized from Whisper's decoder to achieve audio-text feature alignment. - DiVA generalizes well to various spoken language tasks such as Spoken Question Answering, Classification (emotion, humor, and sarcasm detection), and Translation, using only ASR data for training. - In evaluation benchmarks, DiVA outperforms other open-access Speech and Audio LLMs on question answering by a significant margin despite using substantially less compute for training. - DiVA excels in following text-based instructions provided through prompts and user's speech, addressing the "forgetting" issue observed in other models trained using supervised fine-tuning.  - In a user study, DiVA received a 72% preference rate compared to Qwen 2 Audio, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios despite some limitations like inheriting the base LLM's bias. | ['Multimodal', 'Audio', 'Automatic Speech Recognition', 'Question Answering', 'Translation'] | N/A | N/A |
