| [LLaVA-o1: Let Vision Language Models Reason Step-by-Step](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10440) | LiYuan, sunlichao137, Yibing, Pengjin, Xkev | - This paper introduces LLaVA-01, a Vision Language Model (VLM) designed for improved multi-stage reasoning in visual question answering. - LLaVA-01 uses a structured approach with four stages: summarization, visual interpretation, logical reasoning, and conclusion generation, unlike traditional chain-of-thought prompting. - A new dataset, LLaVA-01-100k, was created with structured reasoning annotations from various visual question answering sources, used to fine-tune the Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct model. - A novel stage-level beam search method enables efficient inference-time scaling. - LLaVA-01 surpasses larger and closed-source models like Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-40-mini on multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks. | ['Multimodal', 'Visual Question Answering'] | N/A | N/A |
| [The Dawn of GUI Agent: A Preliminary Case Study with Claude 3.5 Computer Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10323) | Mingyu Ouyang, AnalMom, QuStar, SiyuanH | - This paper presents a preliminary case study on Claude 3.5 Computer Use, a new large language model (LLM) designed for GUI automation. - The study evaluates the model's abilities in planning, action execution, and critic feedback across various desktop environments, including web search, office productivity software, workflow applications, and video games. - The researchers propose a novel framework, Computer Use Out-of-the-Box (OOTB), which offers a cross-platform solution for easy implementation and benchmarking of GUI automation models. - The study identifies some limitations in Claude 3.5's handling of tasks, including scrolling-based navigation and text selection precision, as well as occasional inaccuracies in final outcome evaluations. - The findings suggest the need for future research to focus on improved selection capabilities, more accurate validation feedback, and enhanced adaptability to real-world application complexities. | ['Multimodal'] | [Link](https://github.com/showlab/computer_use_ootb) | N/A |
