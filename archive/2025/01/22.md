| [Agent-R: Training Language Model Agents to Reflect via Iterative Self-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11425) | Zhengyin Du, Zhiheng Xi, Junjie-Ye, lovesnowbest, siyuyuan | - This paper introduces Agent-R, a novel iterative self-training framework designed to improve the error correction capabilities of large language model (LLM) agents in interactive environments. - Agent-R leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to dynamically construct training samples, enabling agents to learn from their mistakes by revising erroneous trajectories. - The framework includes a model-guided critique construction mechanism where the actor model pinpoints the first error in a failed trajectory and splices it with the adjacent correct path, facilitating timely error correction. - Experimental results across three interactive and agentic environments (WebShop, SciWorld, and TextCraft) demonstrate that Agent-R surpasses baseline methods and agents trained on expert trajectories, achieving superior performance (+5.59%). - Agent-R also equips agents with the ability to more effectively identify and correct erroneous actions in real time while avoiding loops, addressing a key limitation of previous methods. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Reinforcement Learning'] | [Link](https://github.com/bytedance/Agent-R) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered) |

| [Demons in the Detail: On Implementing Load Balancing Loss for Training Specialized Mixture-of-Expert Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11873) | Kaiyue Wen, Bo Zheng, Zeyu Huang, Zihan Qiu, Losin94 | - This paper proposes a global-batch load balancing loss (LBL) strategy for training Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, addressing the limitations of the commonly used micro-batch LBL. - The micro-batch LBL enforces load balancing at the sequence level, hindering expert specialization, particularly in domain-specific tasks, whereas the global-batch LBL promotes load balancing at the corpus level, encouraging specialization. - The global-batch LBL involves synchronizing expert selection frequencies across parallel groups, introducing minimal computational overhead. - Experiments on various MoE model sizes (up to 42.8B parameters) trained on up to 400B tokens show that global-batch LBL significantly improves both pre-training perplexity and downstream task performance. - Analysis reveals that global-batch LBL leads to more interpretable expert specialization, aligning routing decisions with the language modeling task. | ['Natural Language Processing'] | N/A | N/A |
