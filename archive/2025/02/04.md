| [The Differences Between Direct Alignment Algorithms are a Blur](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01237) | Boris Shaposhnikov, kefirski, ZeL1k7, ummagumm-a, Myashka | - This paper analyzes Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) for aligning language models with human preferences, focusing on the impact of different design choices like ranking losses (pairwise vs. pointwise), implicit rewards (likelihood ratios, odds ratios), and the necessity of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). - It introduces a scaling parameter \(\beta\) to control the strength of preference optimization for single-stage ORPO and ASFT methods, showing that incorporating an explicit SFT phase improves their performance, matching two-stage methods like DPO. - Through theoretical analysis, the paper reveals shared optimization dynamics between methods using odds ratios or reference-based rewards and demonstrates that the key factor influencing alignment quality is the use of pairwise or pointwise objectives rather than specific implicit reward formulations. - Experimental results on various datasets (UltraChat, UltraFeedback, Reddit TL;DR) and models (Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.2 3B) demonstrate that pairwise methods generally outperform pointwise methods, particularly with larger models, and even a small fraction (5-10%) of SFT data can yield substantial gains. - The study concludes that careful evaluation is crucial for understanding the differences between DAAs and optimizing LLM training pipelines, suggesting that pairwise methods with an SFT phase and tuned hyperparameters are most effective for alignment. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text2Text Generation'] | N/A | N/A |
| [Process Reinforcement through Implicit Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01456) | Wendi Li, Zefan Wang, Lifan Yuan, hanbin, ganqu | - PRIME (Process Reinforcement through IMplicit rEwards) is a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using dense token-level rewards. - PRIME leverages implicit process rewards, derived from an Implicit Process Reward Model (PRM), enabling online updates of the reward model using only outcome labels, which mitigates reward hacking and reduces computational costs compared to traditional methods. - The framework integrates token-level dense rewards and sparse outcome rewards into a Monte Carlo advantage function with a leave-one-out baseline, making it adaptable to various RL algorithms. - Experimental results on mathematical and coding reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PRIME achieves a 15.1% average improvement over the supervised fine-tuning baseline and surpasses the state-of-the-art Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct model on several key benchmarks using significantly less training data. - An ablation study shows that online PRM updating and the use of dense rewards lead to substantial gains in both sample efficiency and overall performance. | ['Reinforcement Learning', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Text Generation'] | [Link](https://github.com/PRIME-RL/PRIME) | N/A |

| [Preference Leakage: A Contamination Problem in LLM-as-a-judge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01534) | Bohan Jiang, Ming Zhong, Yue Huang, Dawei Li, RLSNLP | - This paper introduces the concept of "preference leakage", a contamination problem in Large Language Model (LLM)-as-a-judge scenarios. - Preference leakage occurs when the LLM used for data generation and the LLM used for evaluation are closely related, leading to systematic bias in the evaluation. - The authors define three types of relatedness: being the same model, having an inheritance relationship, and belonging to the same model family. - Experiments across multiple LLM baselines and benchmarks demonstrate the existence of preference leakage and its impact on evaluation results. - The study reveals that preference leakage is a pervasive and challenging problem, especially for subjective evaluation criteria, hindering the development of reliable LLM-based evaluation systems. | ['Natural Language Processing'] | [Link](https://github.com/David-Li0406/Preference-Leakage) | N/A |
