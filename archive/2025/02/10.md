| [VideoRoPE: What Makes for Good Video Rotary Position Embedding?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05173) | Pan Zhang, Xiaoyi Dong, Xilin Wei, yuhangzang, LiuXR | - VideoRoPE, a novel video position embedding strategy designed for video large language models (LLMs), is introduced, improving the encoding of spatiotemporal information in videos. - It addresses four key properties for effective video position encoding: 2D/3D structure, frequency allocation, spatial symmetry, and temporal index scaling. - VideoRoPE utilizes a low-frequency temporal allocation to mitigate periodic oscillation issues, diagonal layout to preserve spatial symmetry, and adjustable temporal spacing to decouple temporal and spatial indexing. - It surpasses existing RoPE variants on tasks like long video retrieval (+12.4 on V-NIAH, +12.4 on V-NIAH-D), video understanding (+2.9 on LongVideoBench, +4.5 on MLVU, +1.7 on Video-MME), and video hallucination (+11.9 on VideoHallucer). - A new challenging benchmark, V-NIAH-D (Visual Needle-In-A-Haystack with Distractors), is introduced to evaluate the robustness of position embedding designs against distractors. | ['Multimodal', 'Video-Text-to-Text', 'Video Classification', 'Video-Text-to-Text'] | [Link](https://github.com/Wiselnn570/VideoROPE) | N/A |
| [QuEST: Stable Training of LLMs with 1-Bit Weights and Activations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05003) | Jiale Chen, d-alistarh, mnikdan97, soroushtabesh, BlackSamorez | - QuEST, a new quantization-aware training (QAT) method, achieves stable training of large language models (LLMs) with weights and activations quantized down to 1-bit. - QuEST improves upon existing QAT methods by using Hadamard normalization and MSE-optimal fitting for accurate and fast quantization, and a new trust gradient estimator for minimizing the error between quantized and full-precision gradients. - When data and compute are scaled proportionally to model size, QuEST trains models with 4-bit weights and activations that achieve superior accuracy compared to BF16 models almost 4x larger. - The method demonstrates stable scaling laws across a range of hardware-supported precisions and model sizes, and can be extended to sparse representations. - GPU kernel support shows that QuEST-trained models can be executed efficiently on commodity hardware. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Generation'] | [Link](https://github.com/IST-DASLab/QUEST) | N/A |
| [DuoGuard: A Two-Player RL-Driven Framework for Multilingual LLM Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05163) | Bo Li, Wei Wang, Junkai Zhang, Yu Yang, ydeng9 | - DuoGuard, a novel two-player Reinforcement Learning framework, is proposed for training multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) guardrails to enhance safety, particularly for under-resourced languages. - A generator and guardrail classifier co-evolve adversarially within the framework to produce synthetic training data, guided by theoretical analysis proving convergence to a Nash equilibrium. - Empirical evaluations demonstrate DuoGuard's superior performance, achieving a 10% improvement over the 8B parameter LlamaGuard3 model on English benchmarks while being 4.5x faster at inference with a smaller 0.5B model. - DuoGuard also addresses the language imbalance issue by generating synthetic data for lower-resource languages, showing substantial advancements in multilingual safety tasks and outperforming existing guardrails by over 20% on average for similarly sized models. - Ablation studies confirm the significant role of synthetic data generation in bridging the data gap between English and other languages, promoting safer and more responsible use of LLMs across different linguistic contexts. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Generation', 'Reinforcement Learning'] | [Link](https://github.com/yihedeng9/DuoGuard) | N/A |
| [Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05171) | Siddharth Singh, John Kirchenbauer, Neel Jain, Sean McLeish, Jonas Geiping | - This paper introduces a novel language model architecture that scales test-time computation through latent reasoning using a recurrent block, enabling arbitrary depth at test time. - The model, trained on a massive dataset of 800 billion tokens with 3.5 billion parameters, iteratively refines its understanding in a latent space, contrasting with chain-of-thought prompting which scales by generating more tokens. - Results demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks compared to open-source models with similar training data and more parameters, reaching computational loads comparable to a 50 billion parameter model. - This recurrent depth approach naturally enables features like adaptive compute, speculative decoding, and KV-cache sharing at inference time. - Analysis of token trajectories in latent space reveal emergent computational behaviors, such as orbiting patterns for numerical reasoning, suggesting the model learns to use its latent space in novel ways. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Generation', 'Question Answering'] | [Link](https://github.com/seal-rg/recurrent-pretraining) | [Link](huggingface.co/tomg-group-umd/huginn-0125) |
| [Linear Correlation in LM's Compositional Generalization and Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04520) | Chengyu Dong, Shibo Hao, Chenyang An, Letian Peng, shangjingbo | - This paper uncovers the phenomenon of linear correlations in next-token prediction (NTP) logits from language models (LMs) during knowledge composition, showing that related knowledge pairs (e.g., "X lives in the city of" and "X lives in the country of") exhibit linear transformations in their logits. - The study finds that this linear transformation is resilient to large-scale fine-tuning and generalizes updated knowledge when aligned with real-world relationships but causes hallucinations when deviated. - Empirical results suggest linear correlation can serve as a potential identifier of LM generalization. - A simple feedforward network with pre-trained vocabulary representations can learn these linear correlations, indicating LM generalization heavily relies on these representations. - This paper investigates the generalization mechanism behind LMs and how it relates to knowledge composition, offering insights into compositional generalization and hallucination. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering'] | [Link](https://github.com/KomeijiForce/LinCorr) | N/A |
| [Generating Symbolic World Models via Test-time Scaling of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04728) | Fuxiang Frank Xia, Tim Z. Xiao, Yuhuan Yuan, Zhouliang Yu, zhangysk | - This paper introduces a novel test-time scaling approach for generating Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) world models using Large Language Models (LLMs), enhancing their planning capabilities without requiring model fine-tuning. - The method employs a two-stage process: Best-of-N (BoN) sampling to generate diverse initial PDDL solutions and instance Verbalized Machine Learning (iVML) to iteratively refine these solutions based on critiques from an optimizer LLM. - This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on PDDL domain generation tasks, surpassing OpenAI's models, with an 85.2% success rate on NL2Domain and 71.4% on Prob2Domain using Qwen2.5-Coder-7B. - By using PDDL as an intermediate abstraction, the method enables more robust planning and mitigates LLM hallucinations, successfully handling complex planning scenarios where direct LLM-based planners fail. - The combination of BoN and iVML balances exploration and exploitation, enabling faster convergence and higher-quality PDDL domain generation compared to using either method alone. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text2Text Generation'] | N/A | N/A |
