| [The Curse of Depth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05795) | Yefeng Zheng, Lu Yin, Xinyuan Song, Wenfang Sun, pengxiang | - This paper introduces "LayerNorm Scaling", a technique to mitigate the Curse of Depth (CoD) in Large Language Models (LLMs), where deeper layers contribute less effectively than expected. - The paper identifies the root cause of CoD as Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN), which leads to exponential growth of output variance with depth, causing gradients in deeper layers to approach an identity matrix. - LayerNorm Scaling mitigates this by scaling the output of layer normalization inversely by the square root of the layer's depth, thus controlling variance and improving the contribution of deeper layers. - Experimental results on LLaMA models (130M to 1B parameters) show that LayerNorm Scaling improves pre-training perplexity and downstream task performance in supervised fine-tuning compared to Pre-LN and other normalization techniques. - The improvement is attributed to the enhanced contribution of deeper layers enabled by LayerNorm Scaling, which results in better representation learning and improved generalization. | ['Natural Language Processing'] | N/A | N/A |
