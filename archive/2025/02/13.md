| [Distillation Scaling Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08606) | Etai Littwin, Jason Ramapuram, Floris Weers, Amitis Shidani, Dan Busbridge | - This paper introduces a distillation scaling law that predicts the performance of a student language model based on the compute budget and its allocation between the student and teacher models. - The scaling law reveals that in certain cases, specifically when a teacher model already exists or will be used for multiple distillations, distillation outperforms supervised pretraining up to a certain compute threshold, which can be determined using the scaling law. - The study shows that compute allocation can be optimized for both teacher and student models to maximize student performance and provides insights into the capacity gap phenomenon, where overly capable teachers may hinder student performance. - The paper also explores compute-optimal distillation scenarios, offering recipes for scenarios like pre-trained teacher availability or cases where teacher training is required, and compares them to supervised learning scenarios. - The findings demonstrate that while supervised learning matches distillation at high compute budgets, distillation can be more efficient for specific cases, potentially aiding in building smaller, more performant language models. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Generation'] | N/A | N/A |

| [NoLiMa: Long-Context Evaluation Beyond Literal Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05167) | Ryan A. Rossi, Trung Bui, Hanieh Deilamsalehy, Franck-Dernoncourt, amodaresi | - This paper introduces NOLIMA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the latent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long-context scenarios. - Unlike existing benchmarks like NIAH which often rely on literal matches between questions and answers, NOLIMA minimizes such overlaps, pushing models to infer latent connections. - The benchmark features a needle set with minimal lexical overlap between question and needle. The question and needle keywords are related through associative links, such as real-world knowledge. - Evaluations on 12 LLMs reveal that performance degrades significantly with increasing context length. Most models perform well on short contexts but poorly on those larger than 2K tokens. For instance, 10 models score at below 50% of their short-context performance on 32K tokens. - The study conducts ablation analysis, chain-of-thought prompting and tests across different complexity levels in latent hops to understand LLM’s failures in generalizing over long contexts when literal matches are absent. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering'] | N/A | N/A |
