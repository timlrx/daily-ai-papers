| [Autellix: An Efficient Serving Engine for LLM Agents as General Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13965) | Tianjun Zhang, Colin Cai, Xiaoxiang Shi, Michael Luo, Chrisyichuan | - Autellix, an LLM serving system, is introduced to minimize end-to-end latency for LLM agents acting as general programs by prioritizing program completion rather than individual LLM calls. - Unlike existing LLM serving systems, Autellix intercepts and enriches program-level context for LLM calls to create an execution graph and two scheduling algorithms: PLAS for single-threaded programs and ATLAS for distributed programs. - These algorithms prioritize calls from programs with less cumulative execution time and dynamically preempt long calls, reducing call and program-level head-of-line blocking.  - Across various LLMs and agent workloads, Autellix exhibits a 4-15x throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art systems like vLLM at the same latency. - Autellix also improves throughput up to 1.5x over standard load balancers when routing calls across multiple engines by accounting for program-level data locality. | ['Natural Language Processing'] | N/A | [Link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/anon8231489123/ShareGPT_Vicuna_unfiltered) |
| [Why Safeguarded Ships Run Aground? Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13946) | Wenjie Li, Jian Wang, Qingyu Yin, Chak Tou Leong | - This paper investigates a phenomenon called Template-Anchored Safety Alignment (TASA) in large language models (LLMs), where safety mechanisms overly rely on the template region between user instruction and model output. - The study confirms TASA's presence across various aligned LLMs through experiments showing attention shifts from instruction to template regions when processing harmful requests, and interventions in the template region significantly influence safety decisions. - A strong link is established between TASA and LLM vulnerabilities, as manipulating template information during response generation allows harmful requests to bypass safeguards, and common attacks disrupt the processing of harmfulness features within this region. - Detaching the safety mechanism from the template by transferring harmfulness probes and injecting them during generation, effectively mitigates these vulnerabilities and improves model robustness. - The findings highlight the need for more sophisticated safety alignment methods that avoid over-reliance on shortcuts like template information. | ['Natural Language Processing'] | N/A | N/A |
