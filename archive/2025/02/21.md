| [How Much Knowledge Can You Pack into a LoRA Adapter without Harming LLM?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14502) | Vasily Konovalov, Daniil Moskovskiy, Maria Marina, msalnikov, memyprokotow | - This paper investigates the extent to which new factual knowledge can be integrated into Large Language Models (LLMs) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) without compromising pre-existing knowledge. - Experiments fine-tuning Llama-3.1-8B-instruct with varying amounts of new knowledge reveal that optimal performance is achieved with a mixture of known and new facts in the training data. - However, over-reliance on new information can negatively impact performance on external question-answering benchmarks and introduce biases towards overrepresented entities. - Two fine-tuning techniques are introduced to counter these effects: incorporating paraphrased new facts and adding facts already known to the model, with analysis indicating that training with HighlyKnown samples is a preferable strategy. - Analysis of knowledge shifts show that positive shifts arise when the model correctly answer questions it couldn't answer before, while negative shifts occur due to the model's convergence on over-represented answers from the training set. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering'] | [Link](https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/knowledge-packing) | [Link](https://hf.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct), [Link](https://hf.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct) |
