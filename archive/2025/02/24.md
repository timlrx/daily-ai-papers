| [SurveyX: Academic Survey Automation via Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14776) | UglyToilet, Ki-Seki, siminniu, fan2goa1, HaruTeru | - This paper introduces SurveyX, a novel automated survey generation system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to address challenges in academic survey creation, such as context window limitations and outdated internal knowledge. - SurveyX employs a two-phase process: Preparation (retrieval and preprocessing of references using a novel AttributeTree method) and Generation (outline creation, content generation, and refinement with multimodal elements like figures and tables). - The system utilizes online reference retrieval, keyword expansion, and a two-step filtering process to ensure up-to-date and relevant sources. - An innovative outline optimization method, "separate-then-reorganize," enhances structure and reduces redundancy, while a RAG-based rewriting module ensures content consistency and citation accuracy. - Experimental results demonstrate SurveyX's superior performance over existing automated systems and near-human expert level quality in content, citation, and reference relevance across multiple metrics. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Generation'] | N/A | N/A |

| [The Relationship Between Reasoning and Performance in Large Language Models -- o3 (mini) Thinks Harder, Not Longer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15631) | Vincent Ginis, Andres Algaba, Marthe Ballon | - This paper investigates the relationship between reasoning length and performance in large language models (LLMs), specifically focusing on the OpenAI o1-mini, o3-mini(m), and o3-mini(h) models on the challenging Omni-MATH benchmark. - The study reveals that more proficient models (o3-mini(m) vs. o1-mini) achieve superior accuracy without generating longer reasoning chains. - Additionally, while deeper reasoning is necessary for solving complex problems, there is a diminishing return, where excessive token usage correlates with reduced accuracy and that this effect is smaller for higher performing models. - o3-mini(h) achieves only a marginal performance gain over o3-mini(m) at a much higher computational cost and more reasoning tokens. - The authors conclude that more efficient reasoning, rather than increased reasoning chain length, is associated with improved performance in more advanced LLMs. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering'] | [Link](https://github.com/MartheBallon/analysis_o3-mini_thinks_harder_not_longer), [Link](https://github.com/KbsdJames/Omni-MATH) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KbsdJames/Omni-MATH), [Link](https://huggingface.co/KbsdJames/Omni-Judge) |
