| [Introducing Visual Perception Token into Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17425) | wxcTest, horseee, rp-yu | - This paper introduces the concept of Visual Perception Tokens, empowering Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to control their visual perception processes, addressing the limitations of current MLLMs' reliance on fixed perception pipelines. - Two types of tokens are proposed: Region Selection Tokens, which prompt the MLLM to re-encode cropped image regions relevant to a query, and Vision Re-Encoding Tokens, which use additional vision encoders (like DINO or SAM) and hidden states to refine visual features. - These tokens are integrated into the MLLM's vocabulary and generated through next-token prediction, enabling seamless integration with the standard training process. - Experimental results demonstrate that a 2B parameter model with Visual Perception Tokens outperforms a 7B model without these tokens by 20% on average across various VQA tasks, showcasing their effectiveness in handling spatial reasoning and fine-grained understanding. - Introducing these tokens to a 2B model led to an average performance improvement of 30.9%. | ['Multimodal', 'Visual Question Answering', 'Document Question Answering'] | [Link](https://github.com/yu-rp/VisualPerceptionToken) | N/A |
| [The Lottery LLM Hypothesis, Rethinking What Abilities Should LLM Compression Preserve?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17535) | Peijie Dong, Qian Wang, Xiang Liu, wenxinsiju, coolzhtang | - This blog post proposes the "Lottery LLM Hypothesis," which suggests that a smaller "lottery" LLM can achieve performance comparable to a larger LLM when augmented with multi-step reasoning and external tools like knowledge retrieval and function calls. - The hypothesis challenges the current focus of LLM compression methods on preserving performance on simple tasks and perplexity, arguing that they overlook crucial abilities like long-context understanding, retrieval-augmented generation, and tool utilization. - The authors review recent advancements in LLMs and propose a recursive, divide-and-conquer reasoning algorithm that utilizes external knowledge, tools, and memory, enabling smaller LLMs to potentially achieve Turing completeness. - The blog post emphasizes the importance of preserving abilities such as retrieval from prompts, identification of required external resources, planning and scheduling, precise approximation of fundamental operations, and long-context reasoning in compressed LLMs. - The Lottery LLM Hypothesis offers a new perspective on LLM compression, suggesting that focusing on these essential abilities could lead to more efficient and capable compressed models that maintain performance on complex tasks with the assistance of external resources and multi-step reasoning. | ['Natural Language Processing'] | N/A | N/A |
