| [Kanana: Compute-efficient Bilingual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18934) | seopbo, Doohae, daniel-rl2, jiyeonham, bzantium | - This paper introduces Kanana, a series of bilingual (Korean and English) language models trained with a focus on computational efficiency. - The models range from 2.1B to 32.5B parameters and utilize techniques like staged pre-training, depth up-scaling, and pruning and distillation to reduce training costs. - Kanana models achieve state-of-the-art performance on Korean benchmarks (KMMLU, HAE-RAE) while maintaining competitive results on English benchmarks (MMLU). - Post-training methods like supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization enhance instruction following and user interaction capabilities. - The models are adapted for various downstream tasks like embedding generation, retrieval-augmented generation, and function calling, demonstrating their versatility. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering', 'Text Generation', 'Feature Extraction'] | [Link](https://github.com/kakao/kanana) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/kakaocorp) |
| [TheoremExplainAgent: Towards Multimodal Explanations for LLM Theorem Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19400) | Jonathan Leung, AlvinYuVotee, KrishKrosh, chongcht, vinesmsuic | - This paper introduces TheoremExplainAgent, a novel agentic approach for generating multimodal theorem explanation videos that integrate symbolic derivations with structured motion graphics and voiceover narration. - The agent consists of a planner that creates a high-level video plan and a coding agent that generates Python animation scripts using Manim. - A new benchmark called TheoremExplainBench consisting of 240 theorems across multiple STEM disciplines is also proposed along with five automated evaluation metrics which are used to evaluate the generated videos. - Experimental results show that the 03-mini model achieves the highest success rate (93.8%) and overall score (0.77) on TheoremExplainBench, and agent-based approaches can generate videos up to 10 minutes long, outperforming agentless methods. - However, limitations persist in visual element layout and retrieval-augmented generation performance, suggesting areas for improvement in spatial reasoning and refinement of AI-generated animations. | ['Text-to-Video', 'Multimodal'] | [Link](https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/TheoremExplainAgent/) | N/A |
