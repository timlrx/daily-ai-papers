| [Retrieval Models Aren't Tool-Savvy: Benchmarking Tool Retrieval for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01763) | Shuaiqiang Wang, Pengjie Ren, Lingyong Yan, Yuhan Wang, Zhengliang Shi | - This paper introduces TOOLRET, a benchmark for evaluating tool retrieval capabilities of information retrieval (IR) models designed to augment large language models (LLMs) for tool-use tasks. - TOOLRET comprises 7.6k diverse retrieval tasks and a corpus of 43k tools sourced from existing datasets and benchmarks, encompassing web APIs, code functions, and customized applications. - Evaluation results reveal that even state-of-the-art IR models, including those excelling in standard benchmarks like MTEB, struggle significantly on TOOLRET, achieving less than 35% Completeness@10. - The authors attribute this performance gap to the low lexical overlap between queries and relevant tools in TOOLRET, demanding more advanced reasoning capabilities from retrieval models compared to conventional IR tasks. - To address this, the paper contributes TOOLRET-train, a large-scale training dataset with over 200k instructional retrieval tasks, leading to substantially improved retrieval performance and higher end-to-end task pass rates for tool-use LLMs when combined with trained IR models. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering'] | N/A | [Link](https://huggingface.co), [Link](https://github.com) |
| [Benchmarking Large Language Models for Multi-Language Software Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01449) | Hung Nguyen, Martin Weyssow, Yindu Su, Chengran Yang, Ting Zhang | - This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Software Vulnerability Detection (SVD) across multiple programming languages (Python, Java, and JavaScript). - The study evaluates five open-source LLMs using prompt engineering, instruction tuning, and sequence classification fine-tuning, and benchmarks them against fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) and static application security testing (SAST) tools. - The researchers find that LLM effectiveness varies across programming languages, with better performance observed on JavaScript compared to Python and Java. Fine-tuning improves LLM effectiveness in JavaScript but not in Python or Java, while prompt engineering methods tend to improve LLM performance on Python and Java. - The study further explored improving SVD by training LLMs with downsampled balanced datasets which showed performance improvement but mostly when original data is imbalanced.  Ensemble methods did not yield substantial improvements in the time-aware split setting used.  - The results suggest that data characteristics and the choice of LLM adaptation strategy play crucial roles in SVD. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering'] | N/A | N/A |
