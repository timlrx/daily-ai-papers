  Insights from SEED-Bench-R1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24376) | yshan2u, yxgeee, ruiwang, tttoaster, ChenYi99 | - This paper introduces SEED-Bench-R1, a new benchmark for evaluating post-training methods for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on video understanding tasks requiring both perception and reasoning. - The benchmark features egocentric videos, multiple-choice questions, and a hierarchical three-level validation set for assessing generalization across in-distribution, cross-environment, and cross-environment-task scenarios. - Using Qwen2-VL-Instruct-7B as a base model, the authors compare Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and find that RL, specifically GRPO, significantly improves performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks, outperforming SFT even with simple outcome-based rewards. - Analysis reveals that RL enhances the model's visual attention but may produce less logically coherent reasoning chains. - The paper suggests future directions such as strengthening the base model's reasoning ability pre-RL and improving reward modeling and RL robustness. | ['Reinforcement Learning', 'Video-Text-to-Text', 'Multimodal'] | [Link](https://github.com/TencentARC/SEED-Bench-R1) | N/A |
