| [CLIMB: CLustering-based Iterative Data Mixture Bootstrapping for
  Language Model Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13161) | Dan Su, Xin Dong, Yonggan Fu, Yu Yang, shizhediao | - CLIMB, a novel framework for automating the search for optimal data mixtures during pre-training of large language models (LLMs), is introduced. - CLIMB consists of three steps: embedding and clustering large-scale datasets, constructing mixture-performance pairs by training proxy models, and fitting a predictor to estimate performance. - When trained on 400 billion tokens with an optimized data mixture, a 1 billion parameter model trained using CLIMB exceeds the performance of the state-of-the-art Llama-3.2-1B model by 2.0%. - Optimizing for a specific domain (e.g., Social Sciences) results in a 5% performance improvement compared to random sampling. - ClimbLab, a 1.2 trillion token corpus with 20 clusters, and ClimbMix, a 400 billion token dataset, are introduced as new datasets for pre-training research. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text2Text Generation'] | N/A | [Link](https://huggingface.co/ClimbMix), [Link](https://huggingface.co/ClimbLab) |
| [Antidistillation Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13146) | Avi Schwarzschild, Zhili Feng, Asher Trockman, arobey1, yashsavani | - This paper introduces "antidistillation sampling," a method designed to mitigate the effectiveness of model distillation by poisoning the reasoning traces generated by large language models (LLMs). - Antidistillation sampling strategically modifies the model's next-token probability distribution during the generation of reasoning traces, striking a balance between maintaining high likelihood under the original distribution and maximizing the negative impact on the performance of distilled models. - The approach focuses on making the generated traces less useful for training student models while preserving the teacher model's performance on downstream tasks. - Experiments using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, Qwen2.5-3B, and Llama-3.2-3B on GSM8K and MATH benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of antidistillation sampling. - The results show that the approach significantly reduces the performance of distilled student models relative to those trained on traces from temperature sampling, for the same teacher performance level. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Generation'] | N/A | N/A |
| [A Strategic Coordination Framework of Small LLMs Matches Large LLMs in
  Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12322) | Honglin Lin, Yu Li, Zinan Tang, Qizhi Pei, GX-XinGao | - This paper introduces GRA, a novel framework leveraging multiple small language models (LLMs) in a collaborative approach for data synthesis, aiming to match or exceed the quality achieved by single large LLMs. - GRA assigns distinct roles to small LLMs (Generator, Reviewer, and Adjudicator) inspired by the peer-review process, promoting iterative refinement and quality control, thus achieving data-level parity with large LLM-based distillation. - Across multiple benchmarks, GRA-produced data matches or exceeds the quality of single large LLM outputs like Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, demonstrating the potential of strategically coordinating smaller LLMs for high-quality data synthesis. - The framework reduces computational resource requirements significantly compared to large LLM distillation. - This study demonstrates the potential of smaller, collaborative LLMs in enhancing efficiency and accessibility of data synthesis | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Generation'] | [Link](https://github.com/GX-XinGao/GRA) | N/A |
| [Packing Input Frame Context in Next-Frame Prediction Models for Video
  Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12626) | Maneesh Agrawala, Lvmin Zhang | - FramePack, a novel neural network structure, enhances video generation by addressing the "forgetting" problem in next-frame prediction, where models struggle to maintain long-range temporal consistency. - FramePack compresses input frames based on their relative importance, allowing models to process a larger number of frames without increasing computational burden. - The structure employs progressive compression by manipulating the transformer's patchify kernel size, ensuring a fixed context length regardless of video duration. - The paper also introduces anti-drifting sampling methods that incorporate bi-directional context to enhance visual quality. - Experiments demonstrate that FramePack can improve existing video diffusion models, allowing higher training batch sizes and yielding more balanced diffusion schedules for enhanced results. | ['Text-to-Video', 'Image-to-Video', 'Video-Text-to-Text', 'Multimodal'] | [Link](https://github.com/lllyasviel/FramePack) | N/A |

  with Retrospective Resampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13169) | Trevor Darrell, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Jiaxin Ge, Heekyung Lee, tsunghanwu | - REVERSE, a novel framework for reducing hallucinations in vision-language models (VLMs), is introduced, unifying generation adjustment and online post-hoc verification within a single VLM architecture. - The approach uses a 1.3M semi-synthetic training dataset with hallucination phrases tagged by special tokens, enabling the VLM to identify potential hallucinations. - Retrospective resampling, a new inference technique, allows the VLM to act as its own verifier, backtracking and revising hallucinations through rejection sampling and query rewriting. - Evaluations show REVERSE achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction, improving CHAIR scores by up to 12% on CHAIR-MSCOCO and 28% on HaloQuest compared to existing methods. - The framework demonstrates significant improvements on hallucination-sensitive captioning and open-ended VQA tasks, while also maintaining performance on discriminative question formats. | ['Multimodal', 'Visual Question Answering', 'Image-to-Text'] | [Link](https://github.com/tsunghan-wu/reverse_vlm) | [Link](https://reverse-vlm.github.io) |

| [Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Conflicting Evidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13079) | Mohit Bansal, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Archiki Prasad, HanNight | - This paper introduces MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent debate approach for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) designed to handle conflicting evidence from multiple sources, including ambiguity, misinformation, and noise. - MADAM-RAG assigns each retrieved document to an LLM agent, which generates an intermediate response. These agents then engage in a multi-round debate, allowing them to refine responses and challenge each other’s claims. - An aggregator summarizes the debate into a coherent final response, filtering out misinformation and presenting multiple valid answers when appropriate. - The authors also introduce RAMDocs, a new dataset that simulates complex scenarios for conflicting evidence. - Experimental results on FaithEval and AmbigDocs demonstrate that MADAM-RAG outperforms existing RAG baselines by up to 15.80% and 11.40%, respectively. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering'] | [Link](https://github.com/HanNight/RAMDocs) | N/A |
| [Sleep-time Compute: Beyond Inference Scaling at Test-time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13171) | Sarah Wooders, Charles Packer, Yu Wang, Charlie Snell, Kevin Lin | - This paper introduces "sleep-time compute," a technique that allows large language models (LLMs) to pre-compute useful information from a given context before a query is presented, reducing test-time compute requirements. - The authors demonstrate that sleep-time compute improves the Pareto frontier of test-time compute vs. accuracy, achieving similar accuracy with 5x less compute on modified versions of Stateful GSM-Symbolic and Stateful AIME reasoning tasks.  - By scaling sleep-time compute and amortizing it across multiple related queries (using Multi-Query GSM-Symbolic), they further boost accuracy and reduce average cost per query by up to 18% and 2.5x, respectively. - Analysis shows that the efficacy of sleep-time compute correlates with the predictability of user queries from the context. - Finally, they apply the technique to a realistic agentic software engineering task, demonstrating its potential in real-world stateful LLM applications. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering'] | [Link](https://github.com/letta-ai/sleep-time-compute) | N/A |
