| [Towards Understanding Camera Motions in Any Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15376) | Jay Karhade, Daniel Jiang, Stephen624, syCen, zhiqiulin | - This paper introduces CameraBench, a large-scale dataset and benchmark designed to improve camera motion understanding consisting of ~3,000 diverse internet videos, annotated with motion primitives and natural language descriptions. - The authors created a taxonomy of camera motion primitives in collaboration with cinematographers, capturing motion across various reference frames and using precise terminology. - The study found that current Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models struggle with semantic primitives and Video-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with geometric primitives. -  They fine-tuned a generative VLM on CameraBench, showing improvements and enabling applications like motion-augmented captioning and video question answering. -  A human study showed that training and experience significantly improves annotation accuracy, with experts outperforming novices, and that a proper training program effectively bridges this gap. | ['Computer Vision', 'Video-Text-to-Text', 'Multimodal'] | [Link](https://linzhiqiu.github.io/papers/camerabench) | N/A |

| [BitNet v2: Native 4-bit Activations with Hadamard Transformation for
  1-bit LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18415) | Furu Wei, Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang | - BitNet v2 introduces native 4-bit activation quantization for 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance efficiency in batched inference. - The core innovation, H-BitLinear, applies an online Hadamard transformation before activation quantization, smoothing outlier-prone distributions for better 4-bit representation. - Trained from scratch with 8-bit activations, BitNet v2 matches BitNet b1.58 performance, then fine-tuned to native 4-bit activations with minimal degradation. - The Hadamard transformation reduces outliers, especially in the intermediate states of attention and FFN layers, enhancing the suitability for INT4 quantization. - Experiments show BitNet v2 with 4-bit activations (BitNet v2 (a4)) achieves performance comparable to BitNet a4.8 while being more computationally efficient for batched inference, exceeding post-training quantization methods like SpinQuant and QuaRot. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Question Answering', 'Text Generation'] | N/A | N/A |

  Languages, and Domains in Video Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17821) | Wenhan Luo, Baotian Hu, Haoyuan Shi, Yunxin Li, Xinyu Chen | - This paper introduces VideoVista-CulturalLingo, a novel video evaluation benchmark designed to address the cultural, linguistic, and domain limitations of existing video comprehension datasets. - The benchmark comprises 1,389 videos and 3,134 question-answer pairs, spanning diverse cultures (China, North America, Europe), languages (Chinese, English), and domains (everyday life and scientific topics). - The dataset creation employed a hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) and human annotation for efficiency and quality. - Evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) revealed that existing models exhibit biases towards Western-centric content and struggle with temporal understanding, particularly in event localization tasks. - Gemini-2.0-Flash achieved the highest overall accuracy (76.3%), while open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL-72B showed promising results (61.3%) but lagged behind in certain tasks like video location. | ['Multimodal', 'Visual Question Answering', 'Video-Text-to-Text'] | [Link](https://github.com/HITsz-TMG/VideoVista) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Uni-MoE/VideoVista-CulturalLingo) |
| [Can Large Language Models Help Multimodal Language Analysis? MMLA: A
  Comprehensive Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16427) | Peiwu Wang, Hua Xu, Yeshuang Zhu, Zhuohang Li, HanleiZhang | - This paper introduces MMLA, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal language analysis capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), encompassing six semantic dimensions (intent, emotion, dialogue act, sentiment, speaking style, and communication behavior) across nine datasets. - The benchmark comprises over 61K multimodal utterances with text, video, and audio modalities, sourced from diverse scenarios and evaluated using zero-shot inference, supervised fine-tuning, and instruction tuning on various LLMs and MLLMs. - Experimental results indicate that MLLMs, particularly after fine-tuning, outperform LLMs, showcasing their potential to leverage non-verbal cues for comprehending complex semantics, with small-scale (7B) MLLMs showing comparable performance to larger ones (72B) after training. Instruction tuning enables foundation models to perform various tasks effectively, even exceeding human performance on specific tasks like intent recognition. - Despite improvements with fine-tuning, the best performing MLLM only reached 69.18% accuracy, highlighting the complexity of high-level semantic understanding in MMLA and setting a new benchmark for future research. - The datasets and code for MMLA are open-sourced to facilitate advancement in the field. | ['Multimodal', 'Natural Language Processing'] | [Link](https://github.com/thuiar/MMLA) | N/A |
| [The Sparse Frontier: Sparse Attention Trade-offs in Transformer LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17768) | Kelly Marchisio, Sebastian Ruder, Renjie Huang, Robert Li, Piotr Nawrot | - This paper explores training-free sparse attention methods to improve long-context capabilities in Transformer LLMs, conducting the largest-scale empirical analysis to date across various model sizes, sequence lengths, and sparsity levels. - The study finds that for very long sequences, larger, highly sparse models outperform smaller, dense models under the same computational budget and that higher sparsity is tolerable during decoding than prefilling, correlating with model size. - There's no single best-performing sparse attention strategy across all tasks; the ideal approach varies depending on the task type and inference phase. - Even moderate sparsity can significantly degrade performance on some tasks, emphasizing the need for careful trade-off evaluation and task-specific customization. - The research introduces novel scaling laws for sparse attention, demonstrating that the findings likely generalize beyond the experimental setup, indicating potential for sparse attention to be instrumental for efficient long-sequence processing in future LLMs. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Generation'] | [Link](https://github.com/PiotrNawrot/sparse-frontier) | N/A |
