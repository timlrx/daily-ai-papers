  Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03318) | Qinglin Lu, Chunyu Wang, Zhimin Li, Yibin Wang, yuhangzang | - This paper introduces UNIFIEDREWARD-THINK, a novel unified multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reward model that enhances the accuracy and reliability of reward signals for both visual understanding and generation tasks. - The model employs an exploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach involving three key stages: cold start, rejection sampling, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to elicit and incentivize the model's latent reasoning capabilities. - UNIFIEDREWARD-THINK demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing baselines across multiple vision reward tasks, outperforming existing methods in various image and video generation and understanding benchmarks. - The model exhibits strong implicit reasoning capabilities, surpassing baselines even without explicit reasoning traces, indicating a robust internalization of CoT reasoning. - The proposed three-stage training pipeline effectively enhances the model's ability to perform multi-dimensional, step-by-step long-chain reasoning, improving both the accuracy and robustness of reward signals. | ['Multimodal', 'Reinforcement Learning'] | N/A | N/A |

  Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02922) | Chengruidong Zhang, Jinkai Zhang, Yaoqi Chen, qianxizhang, baotonglu | - RETROINFER, a novel system, is presented that improves long-context LLM inference by using a vector storage system instead of a key-value cache. - The core of RETROINFER is the wave index, an Attention-Aware Vector index which uses techniques like tripartite attention approximation and accuracy-bounded attention estimation to efficiently and accurately retrieve important tokens. - RETROINFER also uses a wave buffer to manage KV cache placement and computation across GPU and CPU, improving throughput. - Experiments on long-context benchmarks show RETROINFER achieves up to 4.5x speedup over full attention within GPU memory limits and up to 10.5x over sparse attention baselines when KV cache is extended to CPU memory. - The system maintains full-attention-level accuracy. | ['Natural Language Processing'] | [Link](https://github.com/microsoft/RetrievalAttention) | N/A |
