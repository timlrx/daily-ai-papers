| [Scaling Law for Quantization-Aware Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14302) | Zeyue Xue, Yutao Zeng, Jing Liu, Chaoyi Zhang, ChenMnZ | - This paper introduces a unified scaling law for quantization-aware training (QAT) of large language models (LLMs), which models quantization error as a function of model size, training data volume, and quantization group size. - The proposed scaling law is validated through 268 QAT experiments, showing that quantization error decreases with increasing model size but increases with more training tokens and coarser quantization granularity.  - The paper decomposes quantization error into weight and activation components, finding that weight quantization error increases more rapidly with more training tokens, while activation quantization error in the FC2 layer is identified as a primary bottleneck. - A mixed-precision quantization approach is proposed to address the bottleneck, demonstrating that weight and activation quantization errors can converge to similar levels with sufficient training data.  - The findings provide key insights for improving QAT research and development, suggesting that reducing both weight and activation quantization error is important for efficient quantized LLMs. | ['Natural Language Processing', 'Text Generation'] | N/A | N/A |
