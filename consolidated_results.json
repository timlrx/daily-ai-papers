        "summary": "-\"Robot See Robot Do (RSRD)\" is introduced, a method for robots to imitate articulated object manipulation from a single monocular RGB human demonstration, given a static multi-view object scan.\n- RSRD uses 4D Differentiable Part Models (4D-DPM) to recover 3D part motion from monocular video using part-centric feature fields and iterative optimization with geometric regularizers.\n- The robot replicates demonstrated object trajectories by planning bimanual arm motions inducing the same part motion, focusing on the intended behavior rather than mimicking human hand motions.\n- RSRD achieves an average 87% success rate in each phase (registration, planning, grasping, execution), resulting in a 60% total end-to-end success rate across 90 trials with 9 objects.\n- This is achieved using feature fields from pre-trained vision models without task-specific training, fine-tuning, data collection, or annotation.",

        "summary": "- Disco4D is a novel Gaussian Splatting framework that generates and animates 4D clothed humans from a single image, outperforming existing methods by disentangling clothing from the human body.\n- Disco4D uses the SMPL-X model for body representation and Gaussian models for clothing, allowing for detailed generation and flexibility.\n- It leverages diffusion models to enhance 3D generation, particularly for occluded parts, and includes an identity encoding for each clothing Gaussian for asset separation.\n- Disco4D supports 4D human animation with vivid dynamics, enabling virtual try-on and avatar customization.\n- User studies confirm that Disco4D generates higher-fidelity outputs and aligns better with original image content compared to competing methods.",
