        "summary": " - This research introduces MaskLLM, a novel learnable pruning method that generates semi-structured (N:M) sparsity in Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced inference efficiency.\n- MaskLLM distinguishes itself from previous methods by directly learning the distribution of N:M sparsity patterns using Gumbel Softmax sampling, enabling end-to-end training on large datasets and addressing limitations of hand-crafted importance criteria.\n-  Empirical evaluations on various LLMs, including LLaMA-2, Nemotron-4, and GPT-3, demonstrate that MaskLLM surpasses state-of-the-art techniques, achieving a perplexity of 6.72 on LLaMA2-7B compared to SparseGPT's 10.42.\n- The research underscores the efficacy of learning sparsity patterns directly from data, leading to more accurate and efficient compression of LLMs without compromising performance.\n- The adaptability of MaskLLM to downstream tasks and its ability to achieve lossless compression in certain scenarios highlight its potential for practical applications.",

EMOVA utilizes a continuous vision encoder for detailed visual understanding and a semantic-acoustic disentangled speech tokenizer/detokenizer for end-to-end speech processing.  The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both vision-language and speech benchmarks, outperforming models like GPT-4V and Gemini Pro 1.5 on 10 out of 14 vision-language tasks and surpassing the speech LLM Mini-Omni in ASR tasks. EMOVA also enables emotional spoken dialogue by explicitly predicting speech style labels (emotions and pitches) and leveraging a lightweight style module for controllable speech synthesis. This is achieved through a novel text-centric multimodal alignment approach, which leverages publicly available bimodal data and eliminates the reliance on scarce trimodal data.",

The method uses clustering techniques to group together similar token representations and then applies mean pooling to create a single, representative vector, effectively reducing the overall storage footprint. Experiments show that this approach reduces the required vector count by 50% without compromising accuracy, and a 66% reduction still yields strong performance. The paper also demonstrates that TOKEN POOLING can be effectively combined with existing quantization methods, leading to even more significant compression rates while maintaining reasonable retrieval performance.
