        "summary": " - This paper introduces MaskLLM, a novel learnable pruning method designed to induce Semi-structured (N:M) Sparsity in Large Language Models (LLMs), thereby reducing computational overhead during inference.\n - Unlike conventional one-shot pruning techniques, MaskLLM models N:M patterns as a learnable distribution using Gumbel Softmax sampling, facilitating end-to-end training on large-scale datasets and enabling the learning of accurate masks.\n -  Evaluations on various LLMs (LLaMA-2, Nemotron-4, GPT-3) with 2:4 sparsity demonstrate MaskLLM's superiority over existing methods, achieving a significantly lower perplexity of 6.72 on Wikitext compared to 10.42 achieved by state-of-the-art techniques.\n -  MaskLLM supports the transfer learning of sparsity across domains or tasks, enabling the generation of customized masks for specific downstream applications and achieving lossless compression in certain cases.\n -  Through this learnable approach, MaskLLM effectively addresses the limitations of traditional pruning methods, such as the reliance on small calibration sets and the use of inaccurate importance criteria.",
