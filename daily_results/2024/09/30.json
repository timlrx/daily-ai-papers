        "summary": " - MIO is a novel any-to-any foundation model, built upon multimodal tokens, that integrates understanding and generation across four modalities: text, image, speech, and video.\n- It supports generating multimodal interleaved sequences and is trained in four stages: alignment pre-training, interleaved pre-training, speech-enhanced pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning.\n- Experimental results show MIO performs competitively against other dual-modal and any-to-any models and surpasses some modality-specific baselines.\n- It boasts advanced any-to-any capabilities, such as interleaved video-text generation and chain-of-visual-thought reasoning.\n- MIO's design addresses limitations of existing multimodal LLMs by handling diverse modalities in a unified framework and enabling more complex multimodal outputs.",
