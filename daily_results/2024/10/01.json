Cottention maintains performance comparable to softmax attention while significantly reducing memory needs, validated on bidirectional BERT and causal GPT tasks. It is reformulated as a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a finite hidden state, enabling constant memory usage during inference. Results show Cottention as a promising alternative for handling longer sequences without performance loss due to its native linear memory complexity and constant memory footprint during inference.",
