        "summary": "DM-Codec is a novel speech tokenizer that leverages a neural codec architecture with Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) and incorporates two novel distillation approaches: LM-guided and combined LM and SM-guided distillation.\n- The LM-guided approach distills contextual representations from a Language Model (LM) and integrates them with acoustic representations, while the combined approach incorporates semantic representations from a Speech Model (SM) along with contextual and acoustic representations. \n- DM-Codec adopts a streamlined encoder-decoder framework enhanced by a multi-discriminator setup comprising Multi-Scale, Multi-Period, and Multi-Scale Short-Time Fourier Transform discriminators.\n- Experimental results on the LibriSpeech benchmark demonstrate that DM-Codec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, reducing Word Error Rate (WER) by up to 13.46%, Word Information Lost (WIL) by 9.82%, and improving speech quality and intelligibility. \n- The combined distillation approach results in a WER of 4.05 and a WIL of 6.61, surpassing existing speech tokenization models.",
