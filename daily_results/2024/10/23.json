It also introduces a modified causal attention mask to support the 2-D structure of image data. \n- Experimental results on benchmarks like POPE, CHAIR, and MME demonstrate that CCA surpasses existing debiasing methods, improving accuracy and reducing hallucination. \n- CCA also enhances the overall perception capability of LVLMs in multiple-choice visual question answering tasks.",
