For instance, while FT-M and MEMIT achieve near-perfect scores on existing datasets, their efficacy in correcting real-world hallucinations is significantly lower.\n-  ICE and GRACE show superior performance in correcting hallucinations but have limitations in other aspects, particularly robustness, suggesting that the efficacy of current knowledge editing techniques is highly dependent on domains and LLMs and requires further research.",

        "summary": " - Taipan, a hybrid architecture for efficient long-context language modeling, combines the efficiency of Mamba-2 with Selective Attention Layers (SALs) to enhance long-range dependency handling.\n- SALs strategically select tokens requiring long-range interactions, refine their features, and augment them with attention, balancing efficiency and expressiveness.\n- Taipan scales to billions of parameters and demonstrates superior performance on various tasks, including zero-shot language modeling and memory-intensive tasks like in-context retrieval.\n- It achieves linear memory scaling, making it applicable for contexts up to 1 million tokens, and significantly outperforms Transformers and other SSM-based models on long sequences.\n- The ablation study emphasizes the importance of the attention budget and the absence of positional embeddings for efficient and enhanced generalization.",
