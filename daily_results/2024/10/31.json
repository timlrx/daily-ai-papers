        "summary": "- This paper introduces a novel attack, called MoE Tiebreak Leakage, which exploits a vulnerability in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models to extract user prompts.\n- The attack leverages the Expert-Choice-Routing (ECR) strategy, manipulating the order of inputs within a batch to cause predictable token dropping, thereby revealing information about a victim's prompt.\n- The authors successfully demonstrate the attack on a two-layer Mixtral model, extracting almost all secret messages (996/1000) across varying lengths (1-11 tokens), and achieving 99.9% success in recovering individual tokens (4833/4838).\n- The attack's complexity is O(VM\u00b2) for the number of queries to the target model and O(2DNVM\u00b2) for queries to a local model copy, where V is vocabulary size, M is prompt length, D is the number of layers, and N is the number of experts.\n- The paper discusses potential mitigations, including preserving in-batch data independence and introducing stochasticity into the model's routing or capacity parameters.",
