        "summary": "- This paper introduces two new process reward models (PRMs) for mathematical reasoning, Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-7B and Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B, focusing on enhancing the process supervision capabilities.\n- The study demonstrates that conventional Monte Carlo (MC) estimation for training data synthesis is less effective for training PRMs compared to LLM-as-a-judge or human annotation methods.\n- Furthermore, they point out the bias of using Best-of-N (BoN) evaluation alone and advocate for incorporating step-level metrics, such as PROCESSBENCH, for a more comprehensive assessment.\n- A new consensus filtering mechanism which integrates MC estimation with LLM-as-a-judge is proposed to improve both model performance and data efficiency.\n- The proposed models and training mechanisms significantly improve error identification in mathematical reasoning, exceeding the capabilities of existing open-source models and providing guidelines for future PRM development.",
