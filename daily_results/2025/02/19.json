        "summary": " - HEADINFER is a novel inference framework that significantly reduces the GPU memory footprint required for large language model (LLM) inference by employing a head-wise offloading strategy. \n- It offloads the key-value (KV) cache to the CPU RAM while avoiding the need to fully store the KV cache for any transformer layer on the GPU. \n- This is achieved by maintaining only selective attention heads' KV cache on the GPU and computing attention output dynamically. \n- Experimental results demonstrate that HEADINFER achieves a 92% reduction in GPU memory footprint and enables 4-million-token inference with an 8B model on a single consumer GPU with 24GB memory. \n- The approach is evaluated on various LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Gemma) and outperforms existing methods in terms of context length extension.",

Thus, the authors propose an \"eager\" version that utilizes local outer gradients as a proxy during the overlap, improving convergence compared to the naive version.\n- Experiments demonstrate that eager updates reduce bandwidth requirements significantly, approaching 95% compute utilization for 1B, 10B, and 100B parameter models with bandwidths between 1 and 5 Gbit/s.\n- Evaluating on C4 and HellaSwag datasets reveals competitive performance compared to standard DiLoCo and significant improvements over naive delayed outer gradient updates, particularly under low bandwidth conditions.",
