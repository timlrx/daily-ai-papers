        "summary": "- This paper introduces Meta Plan Optimization (MPO), a framework designed to enhance the planning abilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents by incorporating explicit high-level guidance through meta plans.\n- MPO utilizes a meta planner to generate these abstract strategy plans, which are then optimized based on feedback from the agent's performance in the task environment, addressing common issues like planning hallucinations.\n- The framework employs Monte Carlo sampling to assess the effectiveness of the meta plans by measuring task completion rates, and uses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to refine the meta planner based on comparisons between high- and low-performing plans. \n- Experimental results on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld benchmarks show MPO significantly improves agent performance, with gains up to 100%, outperforming existing baselines and explicit guidance methods. \n- MPO provides a plug-and-play solution compatible with existing agent training frameworks, enabling efficient integration and performance boosts without retraining.",
