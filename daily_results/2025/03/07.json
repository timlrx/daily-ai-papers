        "summary": "- This research introduces a novel approach to proactively moderate online discussions on GitHub by predicting conversational derailment, which is when a conversation shifts from productive discourse to negativity and potential toxicity.\n- The authors curated a dataset of 202 toxic GitHub conversations with annotated derailment points and 696 non-toxic conversations, identifying linguistic and conversational dynamics features unique to toxic conversations.\n- Leveraging these features and a Least-to-Most (LtM) prompting technique, they developed an approach that generates Summaries of Conversation Dynamics (SCD) to predict if a conversation will derail into toxicity.\n- This LLM-powered approach, utilizing a two-step prompting process with a large language model (LLaMA-3.1-70B), achieves a 0.69 F1-score and 0.76 precision, significantly outperforming baseline methods like CRAFT and a generic SCD approach.",
