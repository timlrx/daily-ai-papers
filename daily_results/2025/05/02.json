        "summary": "- MediAug introduces a unified framework to evaluate six prominent mix-based data augmentation techniques (MixUp, YOCO, CropMix, CutMix, AugMix, and SnapMix) for medical imaging classification tasks.\n- It benchmarks these techniques with ResNet-50 and ViT-B architectures on brain tumor MRI and eye disease fundus image datasets. \n- MixUp with ResNet-50 achieves 79.19% accuracy, while SnapMix with ViT-B achieves 99.44% accuracy for brain tumor classification. \n- For eye disease classification, YOCO with ResNet-50 achieves 91.60% and CutMix with ViT-B obtains 97.94% accuracy. \n- The study demonstrates that specific augmentation strategy and architecture combinations are optimal for distinct medical imaging applications.",
